# comparehomecities
In this training project, I'm comparing my Home Cities Hannover and Munich. Initally, I wanted to compare the two cities in more than one category. I was thinking about life quality and job situation. Then I used up a lot of time to even find the weather-data. That's why I used only weather for my first iteration

# Technologies
I used R and Plotly.

# Next Steps
Next would be more attributes measuring life quality in both cities.
